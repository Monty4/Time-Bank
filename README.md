## FLOW

- **Seach a service**: Users can search a service, by descripton, city and borough.

- **Contract a user and flow**: Once the user is found, we request the service generating a contract with pending status. This contract may be accepted or cancelled by the contract server or rejected by the client. After the server ends the service and later the client values the server service.

- **Contracts Flow**: The initial state of a contract is 'pending'. The client can change it to reject and the server can cancel it.The following states of an accepted contract are, 'done' when the server has finished the service and 'validated' when the client validates it.
