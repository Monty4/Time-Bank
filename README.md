## FLOW

- **Seach a service**: Users can search a service, by descripton, city and borough.

- **Contract a user**: Once the user has found a user that offers the request service, they can contact by email. At this moment, a contract is generated with status 'Pending'. If user accept to make the job, contract changes to 'Accepted', and when finish, to 'Finished'.

- **Manage contracts** user has the option to value the service, this way users can get TC(time-coins) and can improve their position in the rate. When user is rated, contract status and TC are updated
