- **Regiter**: User must be registered to be able to access.

- **Seach**: User can search users that offers a service, by service or by city zone.

- **Contact & Contract**: Once the user has found a user that offers the request service, they can contact by email. At this moment, a contract is generated with status 'Pending'. If user accept to make the job, contract changes to 'Accepted', and when finish, to 'Finished'.

- **When service is finished** user has the option to value the service, this way users can get TC(time-coins) and can improve their position in the ranking.
